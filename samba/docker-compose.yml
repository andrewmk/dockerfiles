# Share Security:
#  - Container only has access to what it needs to share.
#  - Directory to be shared is mounted into the container read-only.
#  - Samba settings export the share as read-only and allowing guest access.
#  - UID/GID of the 'smbuser' is set to one that won't be given write permissions to files on host.
#  - Minimum SMB version set to SMB2.
#  - User/Group set to 'nobody' on the share I've configured in this file.

version: '2.3'

services:

# Note that "read_only: true" will mount the container's FS as read-only.
# Helps with security, which Samba has had some notorious issues with recently.
